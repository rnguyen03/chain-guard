# User Data Isolation - Security Fix

## Problem
The application was showing ALL applications and vulnerabilities from the database to every user, regardless of who created them. This was a **critical security issue** where users could see other users' data.

## Root Cause
The API endpoints were not filtering data by the authenticated user's ID:
- `GET /api/applications` returned ALL applications: `Application.find()`
- `GET /api/vulnerabilities` returned ALL vulnerabilities: `Vulnerability.find()`

## Solution Implemented

### ✅ 1. Applications API (`api/applications.ts`)

**GET Endpoint** - Now filters by user:
```typescript
// Extract user ID from Auth0 token
const userId = authResult.user?.sub as string;

// Only fetch applications created by this user
const applications = await Application.find({ userId }).sort({ createdAt: -1 });
```

**POST Endpoint** - Forces userId from token:
```typescript
const newApp = new Application({
  ...req.body,
  userId // Override any userId in request body with authenticated user's ID
});
```
This prevents users from creating applications for other users by manipulating the request.

**DELETE Endpoint** - Verifies ownership:
```typescript
// Only delete if the application belongs to this user
const app = await Application.findOneAndDelete({ _id: id, userId });
if (!app) {
  return res.status(404).json({ message: 'Application not found or unauthorized' });
}
```

### ✅ 2. Vulnerabilities API (`api/vulnerabilities.ts`)

Vulnerabilities don't have a direct `userId` field, but they reference applications via `affectedApps`. We filter vulnerabilities by finding only those affecting the user's applications:

```typescript
// Get user's application IDs
const userApps = await Application.find({ userId }).select('_id');
const userAppIds = userApps.map(app => app._id);

// Only fetch vulnerabilities affecting the user's applications
const vulnerabilities = await Vulnerability.find({
  affectedApps: { $in: userAppIds }
})
  .populate('affectedApps')
  .sort({ createdAt: -1 });
```

### ✅ 3. Frontend Update (`src/services/apiService.ts`)

Updated DELETE endpoint to use query parameters (compatible with Vercel serverless):
```typescript
async delete(id: string): Promise<void> {
  await api.delete(`/applications?id=${id}`);
}
```

## Security Guarantees

### 🔒 Multi-Layer Protection

1. **Authentication Required**
   - All endpoints verify Auth0 JWT token
   - Unauthenticated requests are rejected with 401

2. **User ID Extraction**
   - User ID (`sub`) extracted from verified Auth0 token
   - Cannot be faked or manipulated by the client

3. **Database-Level Filtering**
   - All queries filter by `userId`
   - Users can only see/modify their own data

4. **Ownership Verification on DELETE**
   - Deletion only succeeds if the application belongs to the user
   - Prevents unauthorized deletion

## Database Schema

### Application Model
```typescript
{
  userId: String,      // Auth0 user ID (e.g., "auth0|123456")
  name: String,
  vendor: String,
  version: String,
  category: String,
  addedDate: Date
}
```
- Index on `userId` for fast queries
- Compound index on `{ userId, addedDate }` for sorted lists

### Vulnerability Model
```typescript
{
  cveId: String,
  severity: String,
  affectedApps: [ObjectId],  // References Application._id
  // ... other fields
}
```
- No direct userId field
- Filtered via `affectedApps` relationship

## Testing the Fix

### Test 1: User A creates an application
```bash
# User A token
TOKEN_A="eyJhbGci..."

curl -X POST https://your-api.vercel.app/api/applications \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_A" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"name": "App A", "vendor": "Vendor A"}'
```

### Test 2: User B should NOT see User A's application
```bash
# User B token
TOKEN_B="eyJhbGci..."

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_B" \
  https://your-api.vercel.app/api/applications

# Should return empty array or only User B's applications
```

### Test 3: User B cannot delete User A's application
```bash
# Try to delete User A's app with User B's token
curl -X DELETE \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN_B" \
  "https://your-api.vercel.app/api/applications?id=<USER_A_APP_ID>"

# Should return 404: Application not found or unauthorized
```

## Migration Notes

### Existing Data
If you have existing applications in the database without a `userId`:

1. **Option A: Clean slate** (if no important data)
   ```javascript
   // Delete all applications
   db.applications.deleteMany({})
   ```

2. **Option B: Assign to specific user** (if you want to keep data)
   ```javascript
   // Assign all orphaned apps to a specific user
   db.applications.updateMany(
     { userId: { $exists: false } },
     { $set: { userId: "auth0|your-user-id" } }
   )
   ```

3. **Option C: Delete orphaned records**
   ```javascript
   // Delete applications without userId
   db.applications.deleteMany({ userId: { $exists: false } })
   ```

## Security Checklist

- [x] ✅ Authentication required for all endpoints
- [x] ✅ User ID extracted from verified JWT token
- [x] ✅ GET requests filter by userId
- [x] ✅ POST requests force userId from token
- [x] ✅ DELETE requests verify ownership
- [x] ✅ Vulnerabilities filtered by user's applications
- [x] ✅ Cannot access other users' data
- [x] ✅ Cannot modify other users' data
- [x] ✅ Cannot delete other users' data

## What Changed

### Files Modified
1. ✅ `api/applications.ts` - Added user filtering to GET, POST, DELETE
2. ✅ `api/vulnerabilities.ts` - Added user-based filtering via applications
3. ✅ `src/services/apiService.ts` - Updated DELETE endpoint URL format

### What Wasn't Changed
- ❌ Database models (already had `userId` field)
- ❌ Frontend components (no changes needed)
- ❌ Auth0 configuration (already working correctly)

## Performance Impact

**Minimal to None**:
- MongoDB indexes on `userId` make filtering fast
- Compound index `{ userId: 1, addedDate: -1 }` optimizes sorted queries
- Query execution time: O(1) with proper indexing

## Deployment

1. **Deploy to Vercel/Azure**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "fix: Add user data isolation to prevent cross-user data access"
   git push
   ```

2. **Verify in production**:
   - Create an application with User A
   - Login as User B
   - Confirm User B cannot see User A's applications

## Additional Recommendations

### 1. Add User ID to Error Logs
For debugging, log the userId (but not in production error responses):
```typescript
console.error(`[${userId}] Error in applications API:`, error);
```

### 2. Add Rate Limiting
Prevent abuse by limiting requests per user:
```typescript
// Example with Vercel Edge Config or Redis
const requests = await getRateLimitCount(userId);
if (requests > 100) {
  return res.status(429).json({ message: 'Too many requests' });
}
```

### 3. Add Audit Logging
Track user actions for compliance:
```typescript
await AuditLog.create({
  userId,
  action: 'DELETE_APPLICATION',
  resourceId: id,
  timestamp: new Date()
});
```

---

**Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - User data is now properly isolated. Each user can only see and modify their own applications and related vulnerabilities.
